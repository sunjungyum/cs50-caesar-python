# cs50-caesar-python
This program uses Python to encrypt messages using Caesar's cipher, which "rotates" each letter by 'k' positions. The program accepts a single command-line argument, a non-negative integer (k). The program prompts the user for the original plaintext and outputs the ciphertext. The program preserves case.

Assigned as PSET 6 during Harvard's fall 2018 CS50 course.
